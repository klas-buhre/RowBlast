  -Gameplay:
    -Maybe all neighbouring blocks with the same color should be connected with welds?
    -Maybe blocks in the visible part of the field could disappear on some levels. For each move a
     random block disappears.
    -Fix all bugs.
    -Maybe a sensitivity setting. Tetris Blitz has lower sensitility on iPad but not on iPhone.
    -When playing a level with clear objective the game could scroll up if there is no room to spawn
     the falling piece. If we are at the top of the level then it is game over.
    -Undo to the previous move initial state or the the previous move last state before move? Should 
     not really matter since the user can select any piece from the selectables but maybe it is most 
     convenient to go back to the state before the move and not the initial state.
    -Mega bomb?
  -Rendering:
    -Recreate the star particle. Possibly by buying a textures for particle systems in unity assets
     store. Look at: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26701
    -Maybe the bombs could have constant particle effects as if it is about to explode. And they
     could be be of different shapes other than spheres.
    -Add heading to the green dialogs.
    -Try 1334Ã—750 resolution for iPhone7.
    -Camera shake when clearing 5 rows or using a bomb.
    -Try adding welds to the level blocks.
    -One or two stars in level cleared dialog could be placed more in the middle.
    -There could be a particle effect behind the stars in the level cleared dialog. Stars could also
     rotate in around the y axis for about a second and then only rotate around the z axis. During
     this short animation the stars could be scaled up as well.
    -The sliding text could slide in from the left and right; one row from the right and the other
     row from the left like in Stellar. The font could be similar to ethnocentric and have a 
     gradient effect like this in the text shader:
     gl_FragColor = vec4(TextureCoordOut.y, 1.0, 1.0, texture2D(Sampler, TextureCoordOut).a) * TextColor;
     The title text can also have that gradient.
    -Could have a rotating particle/flare in the sliding text animation.
    -The switching of pieces in the selectable pieces HUD could be animated.
    -Could have particles in the FlyingBlocksAnimation in the points from which the blocks gets
     tossed.
    -The blocks in FlyingBlocksAnimation should bounce off each other instead of passing right 
     through.
    -MenuButtons can start a shrink animation when pressed down.
    -Try models with less bevel for the preview. The triangles with less bevel could be tried for
     field also.

Ongoing tasks:
    -GameScene should be a Pht::Scene.

Ideas:
    -The pause button could lead to a widget that has an undo button, a boosters button and a game
     menu button.
    -A booster could destroy all welds in the visible part of the field.

Time Estimation in days:
    -Convert GameScene into a Pht::Scene.

GameScene refactoring:
    Alternative 1:
        -How to handle field blocks/subCells?
            Non-empty subCells can have a pointer to a scene object. Add a color property to SubCell.
            Init/acquire the scene object during level load, piece landing and undo move (but not
            when pulling down loose pieces since those blocks already have scene objects).
            Hide weld scene objects when breaking welds.
            Release block scene object back to FieldBlocks when removing blocks from the field.
            Can have a FieldBlocks class that manages all block scene objects, that the Field can
            use. The renderable objects should be gotten from the PieceResources and LevelResources
            based on mRenderableKind and color. This mean that the *Piece classes should not create
            their own renderable objects (Except the bomb pieces).
        -How to handle flashing blocks?
            Each piece block type can have three versions of its renderable object: normal, flashing,
            blueprint flashing. When a block is flashing, the renderable of the scene object is
            changed to the flashing renderable object. It is possible for the FlashingBlocksAnimation
            to ask the PieceResources to lookup the flashing renderables thanks to the
            SubCell::mRenderableKind enum.
        -How to handle welds?
            The welds can be scene object children of the block scene object. SubCell::mWelds can
            have four weld scene objects. Weld renderables should be gotten from PieceResources.
            But how to handle block rotation? The weld scene objects will be rotated along with the
            parent block scene object which is not good. Maybe the welds cannot be child objects.
        -How to handle collapsing field animation?
            Just set the block scene objects positions in
            CollapsingFieldAnimation::UpdateInActiveState().
        -How to handle undo move?
            First, give back all scene objects to FieldBlocks and then just re-init the block scene
            objects by scanning the field.
        -How to handle the falling piece?
            Each piece type can have its own scene object with blocks as children. The piece scene
            object could be constructed by a PieceSceneObjectBuilder based on fillGrid and color.
            The SubCell::mRenderableKind is calculated from fillGrid by the Piece base class.
            Bomb pieces can override that scene object with their own since they have special
            renderable objects that cannot be inferred from fill and color.

    Alternative 2:
        -How to handle field blocks/subCells?
            SubCells have mRenderableKind and color properties but no scene object property.
            The GameRenderer maintains a pool of scene objects and init available block & weld scene
            objects by scanning the Field if the Field is dirty. The Field becomes dirty during a
            frame when changed. The renderable objects should be gotten from the PieceResources and
            LevelResources based on mRenderableKind and color. This mean that the *Piece classes
            should not create their own renderable objects (Except the bomb pieces).
        -How to handle flashing blocks?
            Each piece block type can have three versions of its renderable object: normal, flashing,
            blueprint flashing. When a block is flashing, the renderable of the scene object is
            changed to the flashing renderable object. It is possible for the GameRenderer
            to ask the PieceResources to lookup the flashing renderables thanks to the
            SubCell::mRenderableKind enum.
        -How to handle welds?
            Handled in the first bullet. The weld scene objects are not child objects.
        -How to handle collapsing field animation?
            Handled in the first bullet.
        -How to handle undo move?
            Handled in the first bullet.
        -How to handle the falling piece?
            Each piece type can have its own scene object with blocks as children. The piece scene
            object could be constructed by a PieceSceneObjectBuilder based on fillGrid and color.
            The SubCell::mRenderableKind is calculated from fillGrid by the Piece base class.
            Bomb pieces can override that scene object with their own since they have special
            renderable objects that cannot be inferred from fill and color.
