Backlog:
  -Gameplay:
    -Maybe a sensitivity setting. Tetris Blitz has lower sensibility on iPad but not on iPhone.
    -When playing a level with clear objective the game could scroll up if there is no room to spawn
     the falling piece. If we are at the top of the level then it is game over.
    -Undo to the previous move initial state or the the previous move last state before move? Should 
     not really matter since the user can select any piece from the selectables but maybe it is most 
     convenient to go back to the state before the move and not the initial state.
    -Mega bomb?
  -Rendering:
    -For bombs there could be a transparent quad showing the blast radius in swipe mode. In click
     mode the blast radius could be shown when touching a move alternative.
    -There should be no fade in/out when going from for example game menu to settings menu.
    -Since the field should not be clipped the next pieces background can be more white.
    -The SlidingMenuAnimation could slide in from the side instead.
    -Add heading to the green dialogs.
    -Try 1334Ã—750 resolution for iPhone7.
    -Try models with less bevel for the preview. The triangles with less bevel could be tried for
     field also.
    -Camera shake when clearing 5 rows.
    -Try adding welds to the level blocks.
    -Recreate the star particle. Possibly by buying a textures for particle systems in unity assets
     store. Look at: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26701
    -The particle system could also support triangles instead of only points so that the particles
     can be rotated around the z-axis. The triangles don't have to be rotated towards the camera so 
     that it is easy to implement (although then it will only work when the camera is at the right 
     angle which is ok for the game). The points rendering could still be used in 3D scenes.
    -The piece drop particle effect should have bigger, fewer, rotating stars.
    -One or two stars in level cleared dialog could be placed more in the middle.
    -There could be a particle effect behind the stars in the level cleared dialog. Could be done
     if ParticleEffect inherits from SceneObject. Stars could also rotate in around the y axis for
     about a second and then only rotate around the z axis. During this short animation the stars
     could be scaled up as well.
    -The sliding text could slide in from the left and right; one row from the right and the other
     row from the left like in Stellar. The font could be similar to ethnocentric and have a 
     gradient effect like this in the text shader:
     gl_FragColor = vec4(TextureCoordOut.y, 1.0, 1.0, texture2D(Sampler, TextureCoordOut).a) * TextColor;
     The title text can also have that gradient.
    -Could have a rotating particle/flare in the sliding text animation.
    -The switching of pieces in the selectable pieces HUD could be animated.
    -Could have particles in the FlyingBlocksAnimation.
    -The blocks in FlyingBlocksAnimation should bounce off each other instead of passing right 
     through.
    -The floating cubes could have materials with the unpatched version of the sky.
    -The angle of the rotating cubes in the title scene and game scene could be configurable/
     deterministic so that the ugly edges in the env mapping is never seen.
    -Could have a set of floating cube configurations for the game scene that always looks good.
    -The cube map textures could be reused for the different materials to reduce memory usage.
    -Maybe the bombs could have constant particle effects as if it is about to explode. And they
     could be be of different shapes other than spheres.
  -Map:
    -Can have clouds in the map.
    -More 3D feel.
    -Load multiple maps.
  -Tutorial:
  -Purchases:
  -Back end:
  -Sound:
    -Buy sounds and music.
  -Make ready for release:
    -Remove text from bottom right part of map texture.
    -Credit the icon creator: <div>Icons made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0" target="_blank">CC 3.0 BY</a></div>
 
Ongoing tasks:
    -Trickier pieces.
    -More long levels with not too many moves.
    -GitHub account.
    -Office.
    -Fix upper part of sky env map texture.
 
Ideas:
    -The pause button could lead to a widget that has an undo button, a boosters button and a game
     menu button.
 

Create rounded cube in Blender:
Scale cube so that size is 1.0. Select the wrench to the right.
Then, Add Modifier > Bevel > turn up width > turn up segments.

triangle_428:
bevel width: 0.085
segments: 5
profile 0.5
Rotated 90 degrees and forward: z direction in export settings.

cube_428:
bevel width: 0.135
weld size: 0.19
segments: 5
profile 0.5

FreeType compilation:
Put the build_freetype.sh script in freetype root dir then execute it.
