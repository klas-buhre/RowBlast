Backlog:
  -Engine:
    -Purchasing.
    -Metal.
    -Net/HTTP.
    -Android.

  -Gameplay:
    -A game objective could be to clear all purple blocks. Purple blocks are affected by gravity
     like the other colored blocks.
    -The UFO could be booster. It could clear 3 rows.
    -Maybe blocks in the visible part of the field could disappear on some levels. For each move a
     random block disappears.
    -Maybe a sensitivity setting. Tetris Blitz has lower sensitivity on iPad but not on iPhone.
    -Maybe the cells above the bomb blast area should be shifted down. This is to avoid the tricky
     situations when there is a big cavity created between gray blocks after bombs and level bombs
     have detonated. This is probably tricky to do in a consistent way.
  -Rendering:
    -The floating blocks in the title scene could be slightly smaller and always have a good preset
     rotation.
    -Animation that moves the map hud out of the screen when clicking buttons in the hud. Could work
     in a similar way as the SlidingFieldAnimation.
    -Animation that moves the pause button out of the screen.
  -GUI:
    -How to play dialog.
  -Make ready for release:
    -Update mail address in legal documents.
    -Go through all user services and check that all state store/load is enabled.
    -Make sure analytics is enabled and that user terms accept is saved and checked.
    -Make sure analytics debug log is disabled.
    -Make sure the correct product price in cents and receipt is sent to analytics.
    -Do a soft launch in a couple of countries? Maybe the nordic countries and UK? Only english
     localization is needed for that.
    -Make launch screens for all supported device resolutions. Should say Teleporter Studios. The
     logo could contain some simple teleporter texture.
     Font: maybe ".Damascus PUA Bold"
    -Make icon.
    -Make sure that creation dates for the resource files that I have created are not too old.
    -Maybe support for different languages.

Ongoing tasks:
    -Move level 20 to world 4. Replace with asteroid.
    -Move level 28 to end of world 3. Replace with asteroid.
    -Move level 31 to end of world 3. Replace with asteroid.
    -Move level 35 to world 4. Replace with asteroid.
    -Move level 37 to end of world 4. Replace with asteroid.
    -Can have a dialog window recommending click controls that pops up if changing to swipe controls
     in the settings menu or options menu. Can explain how swipe controls work and say it is a bit
     harder to use or say that it is for experienced players.
    -Should give free gold coins after a new install.

Decision notes on level bombs:
        -Should level bombs be counted as full blocks that can be used to clear a row?
            -One idea was that rows containging level bombs could be cleared and the level bombs
             should not trigger since the only way of choosing not to use those level bombs would
             have been to fill the row. However, after testing it became clear that rows with level
             bombs were often cleared by mistake during for example cascading, or you would end up
             in a situation where you would have to clear them even though it will lead to failing
             the level. So it was decided that level bombs does not count as full blocks that can
             clear a row. It also solves the ambiguous case when landing on level bombs and at the
             same time clearing the row containg those level bombs and some extra bombs. Should all
             those level bombs be triggered or only the ones landed on?
        -If level bombs get pulled down and land should they trigger?
            -They should not triggering since this could open up for more strategic play by letting
             the player move level bombs to different rows.
        -If pulled down piece blocks (not gray level blocks) land on level bombs should they trigger?
            -In one way it is logical if they trigger since level bombs trigger when pieces land on
             them. On the other hand, it seems to be hard for the player to prevent pulled down
             blocks from accidentaly hitting bombs at lower rows. Probably tricky to implement but
             it might go something like this:
             during pulling down of pieces, Field detects that a level bomb will eventually be
             land on by piece blocks. The Field then adds that event to GameLogic which will
             detonate the level bomb once it is Updated again (after the CollapsingFieldAnimation is
             done with dragging down the piece blocks position).
