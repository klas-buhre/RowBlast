Backlog:
  -Engine:
    -Purchasing.
    -Metal.
    -Net/HTTP.
    -Android.

  -Gameplay:
    -Could have ice blocks that are level blocks that can be used to fill and clear rows but they
     shatter if landed on or if falling down in a cascade. Or, they could turn into a block if the
     ice is cleared which it will be by filling the row or explosion/laser.
    -The UFO could be booster. It could clear 3 rows.
    -Maybe blocks in the visible part of the field could disappear on some levels. For each move,
     one of the colored blocks randomly disappears.
    -Wooden blocks are cleared and shattered only when blocks next to them are cleared by filling a
     row or by bombs.
    -Might have a vertical laser. Can be good to have when dealing with wooden blocks.
    -Can have levels that have lots of spheres instead of blocks. The spheres have different colors
     and you clear them by placing blocks of the same color noext to them. Must there be at least
     2 or three of the same color in a row? Will 3 with same color in an L shape match or only in
     a straight line? Can have ShortIPieces like in dr Mario with 2 colors.
  -Rendering:
    -Add dynamic batching of objects with very few indices and no rotation if the saved cost of
     eliminated state changes is greater than the cost of creating the batch. Then, the clouds can
     be batched and drawn in one draw call instead of 100. Also, a lot of particle effects
     (the explosions, block trails, lasers etc.) that have the same texture/material can be batched.
     The GLES3Renderer could scan ahead in the render queue and sum up the number of future state
     changes required to draw each consecutive batchable object of the same material and compare
     that cost to some pseudo cast of creating the batch of that sequence of batchable objects.
     The batch would go into a preallocated VertexBuffer with large capacity that the GLES3Renderer
     owns. Also, the RenderObject function probably needs take Material/GpuVertexBuffer pairs rather
     than RenderableObjects since a batch consists of a GpuVertexBuffer with CPU-side VertexBuffer
     and a Material and not a RenderableObject.
    -Try to compressing bouncing blocks that lands on lower blocks. Compress the vertical welds on
     each side of the compressed block as well.
    -Animation that moves the map hud out of the screen when clicking buttons in the hud. Could work
     in a similar way as the SlidingFieldAnimation.
    -Animation that moves the pause button out of the screen.
  -Make ready for release:
    -Should give free gold coins after a new install?
    -Maybe only one or two continues per game round? Like in Dr. Mario. And you get 10 more moves.
    -Go through all user services and check that all state store/load is enabled.
    -Make sure analytics is enabled and that user terms accept is saved and checked.
    -Make sure analytics debug log is disabled.
    -Make sure the correct product price in cents and receipt is sent to analytics.
    -Do a soft launch in a couple of countries? Maybe the nordic countries and UK? Only english
     localization is needed for that. And/or, before that, a small soft launch only in one country
     instead of a playtest since that may give bettar data than a playtest since the players will
     mostly be the target audince and in the playtest they are not.

Ongoing tasks:
    -Add drag controls and release. Include the new tutorial.
    -Then release with microtransactions enabled. Market that version.

    -Major user stories before release:
        -Items in the next release (terrain, hud, piece path, bombs dragged piece)  ~2.5 weeks
        -Interacting with publishers                                                ~1 week
        -Reduce the risk mixing up the rotate tap with a drag start.                ~1 week
        -Find more moves.                                                           ~1 week
        -Replace bad levels in world 1 with levels of width 9 and asteroid levels.  ~1 week
        -Remove moves from world 1 to 3 after finding more moves.                   ~0.5 weeks
        -Update the tutorial with drag controls                                     ~1.5 weeks
        -Purchasing                                                                 ~1 week
         Total cost:                                                                 9 weeks


    -Do:
        -3. -Try a vertical gradient in the grid in the selectables container.
            -Try a blue (?) upper bar in the next container.
            -Try a smaller pause button with possibly a thin white upper
             specular to give it better contrast.
            -Try make the two lover rotating blocks not rotate at all so that
             they are always in a good angle without to much specular.

             Redesign the game HUD: dark transparent bars behind containers or      ~3 days
             pods of the same style as the upper hud. Try pods of the same style
             as the upper hud with thin borders and grid.
                -Add a recess on each side of in the outer transparent part of
                 lower hud.
                -Trim the colors in the lower hud.
                -Grid in the whole selectables container?
                -Keep the old selectables container for the space world.
                -Trim the tilt and piece positions.
        -3. Make it more clear that the player is at the end of the level,          ~1 day
            brighter bottom glow or something else. And ther should be a score
            text above the asteroid when at the bottom.
        -3. Reduce the gain in most sounds (clear blocks, button clicks, start      ~1 day
            game, clear level, etc..). Maybe clean up blocks sound in audacity.
            The music track should be switched for the next attempt to clear a
            level after a failed attempt. Reduce music gain as well.
        -3. Maybe a short delay before clearing filled rows after piece lands?      ~2 days
            And a short particle effect with twinkles in the filled row before
            the blocks gets thrown away?
        -3. When using drag controls, maybe the falling piece should only be        ~3 days
            visible when the dragged piece is visible. At least it should
            probably be like that if the drag controls and swipe controls are
            split up like in the point in Maybe Section below.
            when the dragged piece is not visible
        -3. The area covered by the piece path could be a bit brighter or darker.   ~3 days
            It would be visible when the dragged piece is over a valid move and
            the area would move when the dragged piece moves. The ghost piece
            could be of the same style as the path area but a bit brighter.
        -3. Bombs and laser dragged piece with white or red transparent material    ~1 days
            instead of textures.
        -4. Maybe try a "PropellerPiece": XX                                        ~1 days
                                            XX
        -4. Tune all star levels.                                                   ~1 days
        -5. Release.                                                                ~1 days
        -6. Send mail to publishers.
        -2. Just try to reduce the risk mixing up the rotate tap with at drag start. Maybe sort out
         by tuning dragBeginDistanceThreshold. Also, could have a threshold distance that the piece
         must travel in order to be placed, or a minimum drag time. Maybe the touch should be
         treated as a rotate if it not considered a valid drag? Right now the drag is just cancelled
         and there is no rotate. Tune the field y position for the zoomed displays since there is
         more room now after removing one row.
        -5. Release.

    -Mid-term future:
        -Sometimes moves that seem feasible are unreachable due to the way pieces are rotated by the AI.
         Maybe look into some new rotation system like SRS. Or simplify the rotations by just saying that
         if there is a contineous path (at least N cells wide, where N is the max width of the piece)
         from the falling piece to the move then it is legal. Just start a new ValidMovesSearch for each
         sub-area that is considered to be connected (by a path) to the upper-most area and add moves
         found in that sub search to the total result. Ideas:
            -Define core parts of the pieces that the
             validMovesSearch changes the MovingPiece to if a rotation fails, and continue the search
             using the core part. If later there is room for the whole piece then change back to the
             whole piece. Core part for the F is a small L, core of all I is just one cell, core of B
             is probably an O square. However, changing the movingPiece in the search will probably
             cause wierd movements and increase the cost of the search. Instead we could find all moves
             that have not been found yet (that dont cause a collision) and try to search back upwards
             using the core part. If the search finds the valid area and it is possible to cover the
             entire upwards search path with the complete piece then that new move is valid. For
             example, the I piece would not fit in a one-cell wide stair, but the core part would and
             therefore this makes sure that is not a valid moves.
            -Non-reachable empty cells can have red stripes that fade in when starting a drag.
             Preferably with a red egde round the area. To calculate the valid area: for all valid
             moves, fill the valid area by painting the field by moving
             the move upwards until collision or above the falling piece.
        -Update the tutorial with drag controls.
        -Replace bad levels (especially in world 1) with levels of width 9 and asteroid levels. Try
         to make levels that don't have too much open area directly down to the bottom of the field
         from the falling piece since that makes the whole game a bit more random as you cannot see
         below the lowest visible row.
        -Release.
        -Purchasing.
        -Release.
        -Try to get the game featured by apple by contacting them by filling out the form.

    -Maybe:
        -A z-axis (backwards compared to the portal camera movement) camera movement could happen
         after going back to the map after clearing a level before the ufo animation. Can have a
         white fade effect when going to the map scene after clearing a level.
        -Maybe cut the game_track1 a bit earlier.
        -Could have a slower falling piece animation speed for the first tutorial level so that
         players understand that the falling piece has to go to the move.
        -Maybe split up the gesture controls into swipe and drag controls. This could be done
         because it is quite confusing to set up the proper swipe controls as it is now: First,
         select gesture controls, then enable swipe aim piece, then make sure rotate all pieces is
         disabled. Checking 3 different settings is a bit much in a casual game. The drag
         functionality should be available in the swipe controls so that the gestureMovesFactor
         can be completely removed.
        -Maybe let the number of visible level rows in the scroll controller be configurable by the
         level because some levels are better with more look ahead.
        -Finish the valid moves area
            -Fix the stripes.
            -Maybe the valid area should be calculated like this:
            -Init the grid to undefined cells, not invalid cells.
            -Calculate the valid area like before.
            -Calculate the invalid area like this:
             find all possible moves that are not
             collisions but are not valid. For all those moves paint upwards until hitting full cells
             or valid cells. This will be the invalid area.
             This way, the obvious areas (areas that dont even fit the piece for example) are not marked as as invalid.
            -Even this way will not work properly in some cases when some areas of the invalid
             area will look strange /be missing in for example a squared are that is unreachable.
             If the piece is a sevenPiece then there will be at least one cell in the square
             that is not marked as invalid and it will look strange.
        -Make a new pause button at the top-right corner and make a controls toggle button at the pause
         buttons old location. Or, it might be room for both at the bottom left.

Decision notes on level bombs:
        -Should level bombs be counted as full blocks that can be used to clear a row?
            -One idea was that rows containging level bombs could be cleared and the level bombs
             should not trigger since the only way of choosing not to use those level bombs would
             have been to fill the row. However, after testing it became clear that rows with level
             bombs were often cleared by mistake during for example cascading, or you would end up
             in a situation where you would have to clear them even though it will lead to failing
             the level. So it was decided that level bombs does not count as full blocks that can
             clear a row. It also solves the ambiguous case when landing on level bombs and at the
             same time clearing the row containg those level bombs and some extra bombs. Should all
             those level bombs be triggered or only the ones landed on?
        -If level bombs get pulled down and land should they trigger?
            -They should not triggering since this could open up for more strategic play by letting
             the player move level bombs to different rows.
        -If pulled down piece blocks (not gray level blocks) land on level bombs should they trigger?
            -In one way it is logical if they trigger since level bombs trigger when pieces land on
             them. On the other hand, it seems to be hard for the player to prevent pulled down
             blocks from accidentaly hitting bombs at lower rows. Probably tricky to implement but
             it might go something like this:
             during pulling down of pieces, Field detects that a level bomb will eventually be
             land on by piece blocks. The Field then adds that event to GameLogic which will
             detonate the level bomb once it is Updated again (after the CollapsingFieldAnimation is
             done with dragging down the piece blocks position).

FreeType compilation:
Put the build_freetype.sh script in freetype root dir then execute it.


Did this to get around problem with app not launching on device:
Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme -> Info -> Executable -> Ask on Launch
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52415694/ios-12-ipad-denied-launch-request-xcode/52584195#52584195)

A side effect is that the debugger does not work with this setting so can only debug in simulator
and when setting it back the the original settings:
Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme -> Info -> Executable -> Game.app
